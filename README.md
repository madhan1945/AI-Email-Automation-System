## 📖 Overview

The **AI Email Management Automation** system eliminates manual email triage by building a fully autonomous inbox processing pipeline. Incoming emails are retrieved, parsed, classified by an AI model, stored in a structured database, routed to the appropriate handler, and replied to — all without human intervention.

Designed for teams and individuals who need scalable, intelligent email handling with full auditability via database logging.

## 🗂️ Email Categories

The AI classifier assigns each email to one of the following categories, each triggering a distinct automated response:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| 🛠️ Support Request | Technical issues, help requests, troubleshooting |
| 💼 Sales Inquiry | Product questions, pricing, demos, partnership interest |
| 📄 Job Application | CVs, hiring inquiries, recruitment outreach |
| ⚠️ Complaint | Negative feedback, disputes, escalations |
| ❓ General Question | Miscellaneous queries that don't fit other categories |
| 🚫 Spam / Irrelevant | Promotional noise, unsolicited email — no response sent |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) (self-hosted or cloud)
- PostgreSQL database instance
- OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM provider)
- IMAP-enabled email account
- SMTP or Gmail account for outbound responses

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhan1945/AI-Email-Management-Automation.git
   cd AI-Email-Management-Automation
```

2. **Import the workflow**
   - Open your n8n instance
   - Go to **Workflows → Import from file**
   - Select `workflow.json`

3. **Configure credentials** in n8n:
   - `IMAP` — Incoming email account credentials
   - `SMTP / Gmail` — Outbound email credentials
   - `OpenAI API Key` — [Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - `PostgreSQL` — Host, port, database name, username, and password

4. **Set up the database**
   - Ensure your PostgreSQL instance is running
   - Create the required table(s) to match the workflow's insert/update nodes

5. **Activate the workflow**
   - Toggle the workflow to **Active** in n8n
   - The IMAP trigger will begin polling for new emails automatically

## 🔐 Security Note

This repository contains **no credentials or API keys**. All sensitive configuration is managed through n8n's built-in credential manager.

To run this workflow, configure your own:
- IMAP email credentials
- SMTP / Gmail credentials
- OpenAI API Key
- PostgreSQL connection details
